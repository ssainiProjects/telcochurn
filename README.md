This project aims to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset available on Kaggle. I plan to explore various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees and random forests to develop  predictive models that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. Additionally, I aim to analyze the factors that contribute to customer churn and provide insights that can help companies reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.  This project is currently at the code submission stage, and will be followed by a final report.                                                                                 File descriptions: 'Churn EDA Report.ipynb' -- Exploratory Data Analysis ;  'Code Submission' -- Main source code for the project which includes modeling/evaluation ;  'churn.csv' -- telco churn dataset
