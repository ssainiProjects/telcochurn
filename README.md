This project aims to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset available on Kaggle. I plan to explore various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression and decision trees and random forests to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. Additionally,  I aim to analyze the factors that contribute to customer churn and provide insights that can help the companies reduce churn rate and improve customer retention.
